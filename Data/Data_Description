RAW DATAFRAME:

Center Classification Date:
The date when the FDA classified the recall event. This field was converted into standard date format (MM/DD/YYYY) for consistency.

Distribution Pattern:
Details of the locations where recalled products were distributed. Only products distributed within the United States were included in the analysis.

Event Classification:
Indicates the class of the recall (Class I, II, or III) matching Product Classification to reflect the associated health risk. 

Event ID:
A unique identifier representing a firm’s recall event, which may involve one or more products.

FEI Number:
The FDA (Food & Drug Administration) Establishment Identifier (FEI) is a unique identifier assigned by FDA to firms associated with FDA regulated products. Multiple entries may exist for different flavors or types of the same product and duplicates were removed to focus on one unique product per recall.

Nationwide: 
A manually created column indicating whether products were distributed nationwide. This was derived form the Distribution Pattern to ensure all states are appropriately counted, especially when specific states were not listed.

Product Classification:
Specifies the recall class - Class I, II, or III – based on the level of health hazard, where Class I represents the highest risk. This classification mirrors the Event Classification column.

Product Description:
Provides the full name and additional details of the recalled product. Products unrelated to food (cosmetics, shampoo) were filtered out during the cleaning process.

Product ID:
An identifier assigned to each recalled product, regardless of differences in packaging, labeling, or size.

Product Type:
Indicates the type of product being recalled. For this analysis, only food-related recalls were included, with non-food items filtered out during data cleaning.

Reason Category: 
A manually added column created to group recall reasons into broader categories (Listeria, E. Coli, Mold). This was manually filtered and classified based on keywords found in the Reason for Recall description. Common reasons such as Listeria, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Mold, E. Coli, and undeclared allergens or ingredients were prioritized. Other less common reasons were categorized under “Others”.

Recalling Firm City, State, and Country:
Identify the geographic location of the recalling firm.

Recalling Firm Name:
The name of the firm responsible for initiating the recall. This may include the manufacturer, marketer, or distributor.

Reason for Recall: 
Summarizes the specific reason a product was recalled. Entries mentioning “cosmetic” or “shampoo” were excluded to maintain focus on food recalls. 

Status:
Describes the current status of the recall: Ongoing, Completed, Terminated.

Notes on Removed Columns:
•	Center: Removed because all records were assigned to the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), and the analysis focuses solely on food recalls.
•	Recall Details: Removed as the information was deemed irrelevant for the purpose of this analysis.
